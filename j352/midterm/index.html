                    <p>This is a story about proving, with data, that <a href="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/soundcite/latest/css/player.css" class="link" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><span class="soundcite" data-url="https://umd-kalani.github.io/demos/audio/nodiggity.m4a" data-start="0" data-end="30000" data-plays="1">No Diggity by Blackstreet</span></a> is timeless.</p>

                    <p>Until recently, it was impossible to measure the popularity of older music. Billboard charts and album sales only tell us about a song’s popularity at the time of its release.</p>

                    <p>But now we have Spotify, a buffet of all of music, new and old. Tracks with fewer plays are fading into obscurity. And those with more plays are remaining in the cultural ether.</p>

                    <p>20 years have passed since No Diggity's release. Its popularity on Spotify, relative to every other song from the 90s, is a strong signal for whether it will be remembered by our children’s children. So let's examine every song that ever charted, 1990 - 1999, and rank them by number of plays on Spotify, today.</p>

                        <p>Note the tracks that hardly charted on Billboard, in their day. Smells Like Teen Spirit, a track that
                        never
                        reached the Billboard Top 5 when it was released in 1992, is now the most-played song from the 90s.

                        will control what’s relevant from the 90s and carried into the future, independant of quality and
                        commercial
                        success. For rock, that might be Blink-182. For electronica, that might be Sandstorm.</p>

                        Got

                        <p>Since 1992, these songs have slowly faded from culture with the incoming generation, whereas
                        Nirvana’s
                        music
                        has
                        not only maintained its popularity, but augmented it.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>For example, in 1961, Bobby Lewis’s Tossin’ and Turnin’ spent 7 weeks at #1. For all intents and
                        purposes,
                        Bobby
                        Lewis was the Beyonce of 1961. Yet, have you heard of it? Do you know who Bobby Lewis is?</p>
                        
                        <p>Meanwhile, Etta James’ debut album dropped the same year, with At Last peaking on Billboard at #68.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Music historians will regard Bobby Lewis as a pioneer in rock and roll and R&B, yet whatever led to
                        Tossin’
                        and
                        Turnin’s popularity in 1961 has faded over time. His music, for countless reasons, didn’t persevere
                        in
                        the
                        same
                        way as Etta James’.</p>
                        
                        <p>One hypothesis: Tossin’ and Turnin’s success had more to do than just the song...perhaps Bobby Lewis
                        was
                        a
                        huge
                        personality. Great looks. Amazing dancer. <b>When we examine pop hits, popularity is so much more
                        than
                        song
                        quality.</b></p>
                        
                        <p>But future generations don’t remember Bobby Lewis’s dancing and good looks. Spotify only catalogues
                        his
                        music.
                        And unfortunately, that quality didn’t endure in the same way as At Last. (And of course, we have
                        not
                        even
                        considered the role of covers, samples, and movie soundtracks, etc. – a future project to
                        undertake).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>And for this reason, it will be weird to hear future generations reverently listen to groups such as
                        Nickelback –
                        the kids only know their music, not what they culturally stood for in 2015.</p>
                        
                        <p>Thus far we’ve only examined two sets of data points: popularity at release (Billboard) and
                        popularity
                        today
                        (Spotify).</p>
                        
                        <p>Yet, we don’t know what happened in-between: a song’s trajectory from peak popularity until today. If
                        we
                        had
                        such
                        data points, we’d be able to understand how major cultural events or changes in taste influenced the
                        trajectory
                        of a song.</p>
                        
                        <p>With Spotify, we have so much more detail: daily playcounts. We can understand a track's decay rate
                        from
                        its
                        peak
                        popularity: whether it’s quickly fading from culture or holding steady to be played by future
                        generations.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>If we were to review “Best of 2013” lists, Daft Punk’s Get Lucky and Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines
                        would
                        be
                        the
                        cultural touchstones. Get Lucky won the Grammy for Record of the Year and Blurred Lines was
                        nominated.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If my children's children were to ask what we listened to in 2013, I'd pick either of Pharrell’s
                        collaborations
                        or someone like Calvin Harris.</p>
                        
                        <p>But that was two years ago, and we expect popularity to fade. Today, one track in particular has the
                        most
                        interesting trajectory: OneRepublic’s Counting Stars. Counting Stars never had breakout success
                        following
                        its
                        release, yet it has managed to stay in the cultural zeitgeist for more than a year after its peak
                        popularity.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>One hypothesis: Counting Stars had a chance to spread organically via word-of-mouth since its April
                        2013
                        release,
                        cascading from indie music circles to casual listeners. Get Lucky, on the other hand, dominated
                        music
                        channels
                        in its heyday. Most people likely heard the track via mass media rather than friends.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>When a track experiences such a rapid ascent, it’s a deal with the devil: the song achieves
                        commercial
                        success,
                        but it also saturated culture in such a way that there’s immense listening fatigue among fans and
                        fad-like
                        connotations.</p>
                        
                        <p>Lana Del Ray’s Young and Beautiful and Arctic Monkey’s Do I Wanna Know look like modern equivalents
                        of At
                        Last:
                        little commercial success on its release, but steady growth over time. Today in 2015, both tracks
                        are at
                        parity
                        with Royals and Get Lucky, and you’d probably never guess it.</p>
                        
                        <p>What's still popular from different periods in history is almost never the obvious choice. Accolades,
                        Grammys,
                        and cultural dominance mean nothing to future generations.</p>
                        
                        <p>The artists who have cult-followings and underground appeal: it’s a signal for some undefined musical
                        quality
                        that’s impossible for a hit song to replicate. Perhaps it means that they are culturally ahead of
                        their
                        time. Or
                        perhaps generations will feel obligated to share it, for fear of it fading.</p>
                        
                        <p>Either way, time will tell.</p>
