                A recent University of Maryland <a href="https://today.umd.edu/urban-trees-rooted-in-redlining-and-environmental-injustice-umd-led-research-finds" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><span class="study">study</span></a> has linked the lack of trees in 36 Baltimore neighborhoods with redlining.
                <br>
                <br>
                Faculty in the University’s College of Agriculture and Natural Resources helped to publish the study in early October. It compared the environmental quality of 36 modern-day Baltimore neighborhoods to their 1937 Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) loan risk “grades” based off of trees in the neighborhood.
                <br>
                <br>
                HOLC classifications of loan risk rank neighborhoods/properties from most desirable (A= Best) to least desirable (D= “Hazardous” or “redlined”). 
                <br>
                <br>
                The team found that 36 neighborhoods in Baltimore that were considered “D-Grade” by the HOLC, have had fewer trees that are less diverse, smaller, and younger. They studied the neighborhoods based on included the street-tree occupancy, tree-diversity, and tree-composition.
                <br>
                <br>
                The study points to the lack of diversity in the type of trees as a major sign of environmental discrimination in these neighborhoods. – especially red maple trees.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ultimately, the study suggests, “a strategy of planting diverse tree cohorts paired with investments in site rehabilitation and maintenance,” in Baltimore “to overcome ecological feedbacks associated with legacies of environmental injustice.”

                The state of Maryland and various environmental organizations across the state have made initiatives to rectify the environmental injustice and property discrimination that has been caused. The Maryland General Assembly's Tree Solutions Now Act of 2021, which went into effect in June of last year, has called for 5 million trees to be planted across the state by 2031. 500,000 of them must be placed in urban or underserved areas, according to the legislation.
                <br>
                <br>
                The General Assembly has designed for one part of the plan to be achieved through the Chesapeake Tree Trust’s “Urban Trees Grant Program.” The General Assembly has given the local organization $7.7 million in grants to give to local organizations in order to fund their tree planting projects in these urban communities.
                <br>
                <br>
                According to the Chesapeake Bay Trust’s website, “The goal of the Urban Tree Grant Program is to green communities; enhance quality of life, human health, and community livability by improving air quality and reducing urban heat island effect; and mitigate some of the effects of climate change.”

                This grant has allowed local organizations like Blue Water Baltimore to host regular tree plantings, like the one they hosted in the Irvington neighborhood, in October.
                <br>
                <br>
                “We’ve been working in neighborhoods that have been redlined in the past. To plant trees to resignal that there’s growth in the neighborhood, there’s places with shade where people can hang out. Businesses look pretty. And there’s some vitality,” Blue Water Baltimore’s Senior Operations Manager, Darin Crew says. 50 volunteers helped the organization in planting 75 trees in the neighborhood. This is the second year that Blue Water Baltimore has hosted a tree planting in Irvington. Crew also said that many neighborhoods in the city have limited potential to expand the number of trees in the area because of the way they were built, with concrete. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Because of this, the organization is focusing on replanting street trees, as they are, “public investments” and the most “visible”. 
                <br>
                <br>
                “Trees in most neighborhoods are a symbol of economic vitality, a symbol of growth. I mean trees are beautiful, they’re growing. They symbolize like this is a neighborhood I want to live in,” he said.
                <br>
                <br>
                The organization says they strive to plant eight to twelve different types of trees in each neighborhood the replant in. Crew says planting a diversity of trees ensures that when an environmental catastrophe, like a flood or disease, wipes out one species, others survive. Ultimately, he says this simple design, helps to protect the environmental sustainability and efficiency of the neighborhood.
                <br>
                <br>
                In Irvington, volunteers planted White Oak, Hawthorn, Red Buds, and American Elm trees.
                <br>
                <br>
                “If you’re an investor, would you put all your money in red maple? No. You need to diversify your portfolio,” said Crew.
                <br>
                <br>
                The organization says they are looking forward to the overall impact that events like this will have overtime.
                <br>
                <br>
                “I’m hopeful that these trees are gonna outlive all of us. I think that we sometimes think in short term plans but let’s look at a 200-year plan. What is an oak tree gonna do in the course of 200 years,” Blue Water Baltimore’s Community Engagement Manager, Zoe Gensheimer, said.
